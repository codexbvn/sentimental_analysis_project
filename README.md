# Sentiment Analysis for Social Media Project

## Description
Sentiment Analysis for Social Media is a web-based application that allows users to analyze the sentiment of tweets related to a specific keyword or topic. The application fetches tweets from Twitter using the Twitter API, performs sentiment analysis using the TextBlob library, and displays the sentiment distribution along with the tweets and their respective sentiments.

Sentiment analysis, also known as opinion mining, is the process of determining the sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral) expressed in a piece of text. In this project, we apply sentiment analysis to tweets to understand the overall sentiment of tweets related to a particular topic or keyword.

## Project Objectives
The main objectives of the Sentiment Analysis for Social Media project are as follows:

1. **Collecting Tweets**: Implement a data collection module that interacts with the Twitter API to fetch tweets related to a given keyword or topic.

2. **Data Preprocessing**: Develop a data preprocessing module to clean and preprocess the collected tweets by removing URLs, special characters, and other noise.

3. **Sentiment Analysis**: Create a sentiment analysis module using the TextBlob library to analyze the sentiment of the preprocessed tweets and classify them as positive, negative, or neutral.

4. **Web Application**: Build a user-friendly web application using Flask to allow users to enter a keyword, perform sentiment analysis, and visualize the results.

5. **Visualization**: Enhance the web application with interactive data visualization using Chart.js to display the sentiment distribution of the analyzed tweets.

## Getting Twitter API Credentials
To access the Twitter API and collect tweets, you need to create a Twitter Developer Account and obtain API credentials. Follow these steps to get the necessary credentials:

1. **Create a Twitter Developer Account**:
   - Go to the Twitter Developer website: [https://developer.twitter.com/en](https://developer.twitter.com/en)
   - Click on the "Apply" button at the top right corner.
   - Follow the prompts and select the appropriate account type (individual or organization).
   - Provide the required information and agree to the terms.

2. **Create an App**:
   - Once your developer account is approved, log in to the Twitter Developer Dashboard: [https://developer.twitter.com/en/portal/dashboard](https://developer.twitter.com/en/portal/dashboard)
   - Click on the "Projects & Apps" tab in the left sidebar.
   - Click on the "Create App" button.
   - Fill in the required details for your app, such as the name, description, and website (you can use a placeholder URL if you don't have a website).
   - Click on the "Create" button.

3. **Generate API Credentials**:
   - After creating the app, go to the "Keys and tokens" tab.
   - Under "Consumer Keys," you will find your "API Key" and "API Secret Key." These are your Consumer Key (consumer_key) and Consumer Secret (consumer_secret), respectively.
   - Scroll down to the "Access Tokens" section and click on "Create" to generate your Access Token and Access Token Secret. These are your Access Token (access_token) and Access Token Secret (access_token_secret), respectively.

## How to Run the Project
To run the Sentiment Analysis for Social Media project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.
2. Install the required libraries by running: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Replace "YOUR_CONSUMER_KEY," "YOUR_CONSUMER_SECRET," "YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN," and "YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET" in the code with your actual Twitter API credentials.
4. Start the web application by running: `python app.py`
5. Access the application by opening your web browser and navigating to: [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)

## Features and Improvements
The Sentiment Analysis for Social Media project includes the following features:

- **User-friendly Interface**: The web app has a clean and user-friendly interface with responsive design using Bootstrap.

- **Sentiment Analysis Results**: After entering a keyword, the application performs sentiment analysis on the fetched tweets and displays the sentiment distribution (positive, negative, neutral) using interactive bar charts.

- **Tweet Display**: The web app shows the analyzed tweets along with their respective sentiments in a list format.

- **Multi-Threading**: The application uses threads to perform data preprocessing and sentiment analysis concurrently, improving performance for large datasets.

## Future Enhancements
The project can be further improved with the following enhancements:

- **Caching**: Implement caching to reduce redundant API calls for the same keyword and improve response time.

- **User Authentication**: Add user authentication to allow multiple users to access the application securely.

- **Advanced Visualization**: Expand data visualization to include word clouds and other interesting visualizations to provide more insights into tweet sentiments.
